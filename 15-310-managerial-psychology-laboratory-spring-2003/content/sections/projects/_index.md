No Parking or Frayed Tempers in the Sloan Lot
---------------------------------------------

*   Organizations must often provide services for multiple constituencies with conflicting objectives.
*   Parking is a good example.
*   Devise (or find) a general approach to solving such problems.
*   Apply it to this example.
*   Critique the applicability of the approach to other settings.

Students should submit the Project Proposal Form by Lecture 8 ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/projects/groupprojectproposaltemplate))
